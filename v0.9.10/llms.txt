The `tern` R package contains analysis functions to create tables and
graphs used for clinical trial reporting.

The package provides a large range of functionality, such as:

Data visualizations:

- Line plots
  ([`g_lineplot`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/latest-tag/reference/g_lineplot.html))
- Kaplan-Meier plots
  ([`g_km`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/latest-tag/reference/g_km.html))
- Forest plots
  ([`g_forest`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/latest-tag/reference/g_forest.html))
- STEP graphs
  ([`g_step`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/latest-tag/reference/g_step.html))
- Individual patient plots
  ([`g_ipp`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/latest-tag/reference/g_ipp.html))
- Waterfall plots
  ([`g_waterfall`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/latest-tag/reference/g_waterfall.html))
- Bland-Altman plots
  ([`g_bland_altman`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/latest-tag/reference/g_bland_altman.html))

Statistical model fit summaries:

- Logistic regression
  ([`summarize_logistic`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/latest-tag/reference/summarize_logistic.html))
- Cox regression
  ([`summarize_coxreg`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/latest-tag/reference/cox_regression.html))

Analysis tables:

- See a list of all available analyze functions
  [here](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/latest-tag/reference/analyze_functions.html)
- See a list of all available summarize functions

- See a list of all available column-wise analysis functions
  [here](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/latest-tag/reference/analyze_colvars_functions.html)

Many of these outputs are available to be added into
[`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/) shiny applications
for interactive exploration of data. These `teal` modules are available
in the
[`teal.modules.clinical`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.modules.clinical/)
package.

See the [TLG
Catalog](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tlg-catalog/) for an
extensive catalog of example clinical trial tables, listings, and graphs
created using `tern` functionality.

## Installation

`tern` is available on CRAN and you can install the latest released
version with:

``` r
install.packages("tern")
```

or you can install the latest development version directly from GitHub
by running the following:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("insightsengineering/tern")
```

## Analysis Functions

Analyze functions with their corresponding statistics functions and
formatted analysis functions.

- **Analyze functions** are used in combination with `rtables` layout
  functions in the pipeline which creates the table.

- **Statistics functions** (denoted by `s_` prefix) compute the numbers
  that are tabulated later. In order to separate computation from
  formatting, they do not take care of `rcell` type formatting
  themselves.

- **Formatted analysis functions** (denoted by `a_` prefix) apply
  formatting to results from their corresponding statistics functions.
  They are used as `afun` in
  [`rtables::analyze()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/latest-tag/reference/analyze.html).
