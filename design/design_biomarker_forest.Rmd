## Idea

Instead of dichotomizing biomarker values into low/high groups and then creating
a forest plot that compares these groups in different subpopulations (e.g. [SFG3](https://docs.nest.roche.com/releases/2021_07_07/embedded/biomarker-catalog/tlg_catalog/graphs/sfg03/) or [SFG4](https://docs.nest.roche.com/releases/2021_07_07/embedded/biomarker-catalog/tlg_catalog/graphs/sfg04/)), 
here we want to show the continuous biomarker effects (i.e. how much does one unit
increase change the odds or the hazard).
Since we might want to look at the sensitivity of the results with regards to different
regression models or patient populations we need additional columns for that as well.

## Layout

So overall columns could be:

- Biomarker
- Population
- Model
- n

Then for survival:

- Events
- Median (Months)
- HR

Or for response:

- Response Rate
- Odds Ratio

And for both:

- 95% CI
- p-value
