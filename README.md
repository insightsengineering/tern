# tern

test.

The `tern` R package contains analysis functions to create tables,
listings and graphs (TLGs) as used in clinical trials. We also provide
the `teal` modules for outputs in `tern` in the `teal.modules.clinical` R package.
For more details see [here](https://go.roche.com/agile-R).

  - Note that tern can be used to create output for regulatory submissions when used in the enableR system. 
  
  - Use of tern in other contexts/systems is for exploratory analysis, quality control, etc.
