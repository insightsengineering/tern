The `tern` R package contains analysis functions to create tables and graphs used for clinical trial reporting.

The package provides a large range of functionality, for example:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD007 MD030 -->
-   Data visualizations:
    -   forest plots
    -   line plots
    -   Kaplan-Meier plots
    -   ...
-   Statistical model fits:
    -   logistic regression
    -   Cox regression
    -   ...
-   Summary tables:
    -   unique patients
    -   exposure across patients
    -   change from baseline for parameters
    -   ...

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD007 MD030 -->

Many of these outputs are available to be added into [`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/main/) applications for interactive exploration of data. These `teal` modules are available in the [`teal.modules.clinical`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.modules.clinical/main/) package.
