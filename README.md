The `tern` R package contains analysis functions to create tables and graphs used for clinical trial reporting.

The package provides a large range of functionality, such as:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD007 MD030 -->

Data visualizations:

-   Line plots ([`g_lineplot`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/reference/g_lineplot.html))
-   Kaplan-Meier plots ([`g_km`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/reference/g_km.html))
-   Forest plots ([`g_forest`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/reference/g_forest.html))
-   STEP graphs ([`g_step`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/reference/g_step.html))
-   Individual patient plots ([`g_ipp`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/reference/individual_patient_plot.html))
-   Waterfall plots ([`g_waterfall`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/reference/g_waterfall.html))

Statistical model fit summaries:

-   Logistic regression ([`summarize_logistic`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/reference/summarize_logistic.html))
-   Cox regression ([`summarize_coxreg`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/reference/cox_regression.html))

Analysis tables:

-   See a list of all available summarize functions [here](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/reference/summarize_functions.html)
-   See a list of all available column-wise analysis functions [here](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/reference/analyze_colvars_functions.html)

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD007 MD030 -->

Many of these outputs are available to be added into [`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/) shiny applications for interactive exploration of data. These `teal` modules are available in the [`teal.modules.clinical`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.modules.clinical/) package.

See the [TLG Catalog](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tlg-catalog/) for an extensive catalog of example clinical trial tables, listings, and graphs created using `tern` functionality.

## Installation

`tern` is available on CRAN and you can install the latest released version with:

```r
install.packages("tern")
```

or you can install the latest development version directly from GitHub by running the following:

```r
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/tern")
```

Note that it is recommended you [create and use a `GITHUB_PAT`](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) if installing from GitHub.
