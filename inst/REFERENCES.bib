  abstract  = "This article proposes the stratified Wilson confidence interval
               for multiple binomial proportions and the stratified Newcombe
               confidence intervals for multiple binomial proportion
               differences. Both confidence intervals are presented in closed
               forms to facilitate easy calculations. The confidence levels of
               the proposed intervals are theoretically justified and
               demonstrated through extensive simulations. The coverage rates
               are found to be rather satisfactory. When the Wilson and
               Newcombe methods are used in unstratified analysis, the proposed
               methods may serve as the counterparts for stratified analysis.
               The proposed methods are applied to a vaccine trial to compute
               the stratified sero-conversion rate and rate difference over
               multiple clinical centers.",
