  abstract  = "This article proposes the stratified Wilson confidence interval
               for multiple binomial proportions and the stratified Newcombe
               confidence intervals for multiple binomial proportion
               differences. Both confidence intervals are presented in closed
               forms to facilitate easy calculations. The confidence levels of
               the proposed intervals are theoretically justified and
               demonstrated through extensive simulations. The coverage rates
               are found to be rather satisfactory. When the Wilson and
               Newcombe methods are used in unstratified analysis, the proposed
               methods may serve as the counterparts for stratified analysis.
               The proposed methods are applied to a vaccine trial to compute
               the stratified sero-conversion rate and rate difference over
               multiple clinical centers.",

  title     = "Comparing two independent binomial proportions by a modified chi

  author    = "Schouten, H J A and Molenaar, I W and Van Strik, R and Boomsma,
               A",
  abstract  = "When using the chi square test to compare the proportions of
               successes in two independent binomial samples, a new continuity
               correction is proposed, which equals half the size of the
               smaller sample. Exact computations of unconditional
               tail‐probabilities, together with a theoretical argument, show
               that this correction is more appropriate than the YATES
               correction. This version of the chi square test is still
               conservative, but less so, and as a consequence more powerful,
               than the YATES corrected test.",
