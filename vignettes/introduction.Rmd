## Introduction to tern

---------

This vignette introduces the `tern` package, its general purpose and syntax.
The `tern` R package contains analysis functions to create tables and graphs used for clinical trial reporting.
The main focus was put on the tabulation for clinical trial reporting.
The core functionality for tabulation is built on the more general purpose `rtables` package.
It is strongly recommended to begin by reading the "Introduction to rtables" vignette to become familiar with the `rtables` concepts.

---------

## Common clinical trials analyses in `R`

The package provides a large range of functionality:

summary tables:
unique patients
exposure across patients
change from baseline for parameters
…
statistical model fits:
MMRM
logistic regression
Cox regression
…
data visualizations:
forest plots
line plots
Kaplan-Meier plots
…

Many of these outputs are available to be added into `teal` applications for interactive exploration of data. 
These `teal` modules are available in the `teal.modules.clinical` package.
