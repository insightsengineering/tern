# Reporting an Issue with tern

Please briefly describe your problem and, when relevant, the output you expect.
Please also provide the output of `utils::sessionInfo()` or
`devtools::session_info()` at the end of your post.

If at all possible, please include a [minimal, reproducible
example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example). If the data is restricted for your example then try to generate random data that re-creates the problem, the [random.cdisc.data](https://github.roche.com/Rpackages/random.cdisc.data) R package might be useful for that.
The `tern` team will be much more likely to resolve your issue if they are
able to reproduce it themselves locally.

Please delete this preamble after you have read it.
