* Updated `s_summary` and `s_compare` to allow `NA` values in input variables. For factor variables with `NA`s, if `na.rm = FALSE` an explicit `NA` level will be automatically added. `na.rm = TRUE` will also consider `"<Missing>"` values and exclude them.
* Updated purpose of `na_level` parameter in `s_summary` and `s_compare` to align with other `tern` functions. Instead of being a string to consider as `NA` when setting `na.rm = TRUE`, it now defines a string to print in place of `NA` values in the output table.

# tern 0.7.6

### New features
* Added `h_map_for_count_abnormal` to create the map used in `trim_levels_to_map` split function by calling this helper function. It supports two methods: one with all observed mapping, one with at least low limit above zero and at least one non missing high limit.
* Added `s_summary_numeric_in_cols` and `summarize_vars_numeric_in_cols` functions to generate summary statistics in columns, mainly used for PK datasets.

* Added option to also convert logical variables to factor variables in `df_explicit_na`.
* Refactored `h_append_grade_groups` to improve its flexibility, robustness and clearness, and to make sure the result is ordering according to the order of `grade_groups`. Also, added `remove_single` argument which controls whether the elements of one-element grade groups are in the output or removed.
* Added `var_labels` and `show_labels` arguments to `count_occurrences` and `count_patients_with_flags` to allow for creation of a title row.
* Added `na_level` argument to `count_abnormal_by_baseline`.
* Updated `h_append_grade_groups` to no longer fill-in empty grade groups with zeros.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed `prop_diff_cmh` to handle edge case of no FALSE (or TRUE) responses.
* Enhanced `g_mmrm_diagnostic` to improve error handling when data is not amenable to the Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing.
* Fixes in `g_km`:
  * Plot can now display any combination of the annotation tables for number of patients at risk, median survival time, and `CoxPH` summary.
  * Function will return a warning instead of an error if the `arm` variable includes a single level and `annot_coxph = TRUE`.
  * Lines in the plot now start at time 0 and probability 1.
  * Category labels can include the equals sign.

* Updated `cox_regression` to work without covariates. Also in case of interaction model summary, p-values for main effect coefficients are no longer displayed.
* Descriptive statistics returned by `summarize_vars` now include quantiles. `summarize_vars` now accepts the control function `control_summarize_vars` to specify details about confidence level for mean and median and quantile details. The `control` argument replaces `conf_level`.
* Added `var_labels` and `show_labels` arguments to `count_occurrences_by_grade`.
* Changed `indent` argument in `append_varlabels` to accept non-negative integer to represent the indent space defined by user. Previous calls with Boolean `indent` will do an integer conversion and produce a warning.

### Bug Fixes
* Corrected `tabulate_survival_subgroups` and related survival forest plot functions to use total number of events, instead of observations, as default for scaling the symbol sizes in the plot. (The user might still use total number of observations manually if they wish to do so.)
* Helper function `h_adsl_adlb_merge_using_worst_flag` will now impute `BTOXGR` for missing visits.

* Deleted `count_abnormal_by_worst_grade_by_baseline` and its related statistic and analysis functions as a simpler design will create lab abnormality tables.
* Switched data in examples to use `scda` instead of `random.cdisc.data` package.

# tern 0.7.3

### New Features
* Added Subgroup Treatment Effect Pattern (STEP) model fitting functions `fit_rsp_step` and `fit_survival_step`, the corresponding tidy method `tidy.step` as well as the graph function `g_step`.
* Added new layout function `compare_vars` which compares variables of different types between columns and produces a p-value for the comparison to the reference column. Function built on top of the `summarize_vars` functionality.
* Added utility functions:
  * `cut_quantile_bins` cuts a numeric vector into quantile bins.
  * `fct_collapse_only` collapses levels of a factor and keeps those in the order provided.
  * `fct_explicit_na_if` inserts explicit missings in a factor based on a condition.
  * `range_noinf` is a kind of a wrapper function of `base::range`. It returns `c(NA, NA)` instead of `c(-Inf, Inf)` for zero-length data.

### Enhancements
* Cox regression via `fit_coxreg_univar` and `fit_coxreg_multivar` is now also possible without treatment arm. In the univariate case this means that it fits separate univariate models for the provided covariates and tabulation of corresponding effect estimates can later occur.
* Added `fraction` in result returned by `s_count_occurrences`. It contains a list of numerators and denominators with one element per occurrence.
* Updated `sum_num_patients` and `count_occurrences` for the result `unique` and `count_fraction` to return (0, 0) when input is empty.
* Added a new argument `groups_lists` to `extract_survival_subgroups`, `extract_rsp_subgroups` and associated helper functions which allows to group factor levels of subgroup variables into manually defined groups, enhancing the flexibility of the resulting forest graphs.
* Forest graph function `g_forest` now extracts default arguments from attributes of the input table produced by `tabulate_rsp_subgroups` and `tabulate_survival_subgroups` so that the user does not have to do this manually anymore.
* In `g_km`:
  * Remove arm variable name from arm labels in plot legend and annotation tables.
  * Show symbol used to mark censored cases and match order of arm variable factor levels in the legend.
  * Display hazard ratio and its confidence interval to two decimal places.
  * Updated default position of hazard ratio table to stay on the left bottom corner but above x-axis.
  * Use arm value as strata name in when treatment arm variable has a single level.
* Updated `s_surv_time` function to use a newly created function `range_noinf` instead of `base::range`.
* New argument `no_fillin_visits` added to `h_adsl_adlb_merge_using_worst_flag` to specify excluded visits from the post-baseline worst toxicity grade output. Improved `h_adsl_adlb_merge_using_worst_flag` to include variables shared between `adsl` and `adlb`, along with `PARAM`, `PARAMCD`, `ATOXGR`, `BTOXGR` and optionally `AVISIT`, `AVISITN` when `by_visit = TRUE`. Prior output contained `USUBJID`, `ARMCD`, `PARAMCD`, `ATOXGR`, and `BTOXGR`.

### Bug Fixes
* Fix bug in `s_surv_timepoint` for cases when there are zero patients at risk.
* Modified `stat_median_ci` function so that when passing empty var with empty name, no `row names contain missing values` error would show.

### Miscellaneous
* Deprecated `s_cox_univariate` function, use `fit_coxreg_univar` function instead.
* Updated default formats of `hr` and `hr_ci` in `a_coxph_pairwise` and median in `s_surv_time` to align with STREAM.
* Updated the pre-processing code in the files `test-table_ttet01.R` and `test-table_dort01.R` to make sure the analysis variable `EVNT1` has both levels of the factor defined.
* Improved error message when number of levels in a factor variable in a data frame is not as expected.

# tern 0.7.2
* Fixed column label internal test errors.

# tern 0.7.1
* New argument `position_surv_med` added to `g_km` to move position of the annotation table with median survival times.
* Fixed bug in `g_km` related to the ignored arguments `pch` and `size` which were not passed on to helper function `h_ggkm`.
* Updated `xticks` and `max_time` arguments in `g_km` for greater functionality. `max_time` added as an argument in `h_xticks` to allow this.
* Fixed bug in `prop_diff_cmh` that led to `NaN` weighted proportion difference estimates and missing confidence intervals. Before this change, when including no patients from one treatment arm for at least one stratum the estimation did not lead to numeric results.
* Fixed bug in `prop_cmh` giving an error in case of at least one stratum containing less than two observations.
* New argument `n_events` added to `estimate_incidence_rate`.
* New argument `denom` added to `count_occurrences`.
* New arguments `yval` and `ci_ribbon` added to `g_km`.
* Add new individual patient plot function `g_ipp` along with helpers `h_g_ipp` and `h_set_nest_theme`.
* Fixed bug in `count_patients_with_events`, now shows zero counts without percentage.
* Fixed bug in `get_mmrm_lsmeans` which did not allow `MMRM` analysis of more than 3000 observations.
* Updated `stat_mean_ci` and `stat_median_ci` to handle edge cases with number of elements in input series equal to 1. For such cases, `NA_real_` is now returned, instead of `NA` or `+/-Inf` for confidence interval (CI) estimates.
* Rename `n_lim` argument of `stat_mean_ci` to `n_min` to better reflect its desired meaning.

# tern 0.7.0
This version of `tern` introduces a major rewriting of `tern` due to the change to layout based tabulation in `rtables`. `tern` now does not build tables directly anymore, instead it provides analysis functions to build tables, see the examples.
* Counting patients with abnormal values post-baseline with `count_abnormal`.
* Counting patients with graded abnormal values with `count_abnormal_by_worst_grade`.
* Counting patients with abnormal values by baseline status with `count_abnormal_by_baseline`.
* Counting patients with missed doses with `s_count_missed_doses` and `count_missed_doses`.
* Counting patients with event flags with `count_patients_with_event` and `count_patients_with_flags`.
* Summarizing variables with `summarize_vars` (supports numeric, factor, character and logical variables). Note that factors need to have `NA`s converted to `na_level` before use.
* Summarizing change from baseline with `summarize_change`.
* Summarizing variables in columns with `summarize_colvars`.
* Estimating difference for responder proportions with `estimate_proportion_diff`.
* Estimating difference for Odds Ratio with `estimate_odds_ratio`.
* Testing the difference in responder proportions with `test_proportion_diff`.
* Estimating the responder proportion for the level of a factor with `estimate_multinomial_response`.
* Fitting and tabulating the results of Cox regressions with `fit_coxreg_univar`, `fit_coxreg_multivar` and `summarize_coxreg`, respectively.
* Pruning occurrence tables (or tables with counts and fractions) with flexible rules, see `?prune_occurrences` for details.
* Sorting occurrence tables using different options, see `?score_occurrences` for details.
* Fitting and tabulating `MMRM` models with `fit_mmrm` and `as.rtable` and `summarize_lsmeans`, see `?tabulate_mmrm` for details.
* Counting the number of unique and non-unique patients with `summarize_num_patients`.
* Counting occurrences with `count_occurrences`.
* Counting occurrences by grade with `summarize_occurrences_by_grade` and `count_occurrences_by_grade`.
* Counting patients and events in columns with `summarize_patients_events_in_cols`.
* Tabulating the binary outcome response by subgroup with `extract_rsp_subgroups` and `tabulate_rsp_subgroups`.
* Tabulating the survival duration by subgroup with `extract_survival_subgroups` and `tabulate_survival_subgroups`.

# tern 0.6.9
* Removing not used imports.

# tern 0.6.8
* Improved handling of missing data in aggregation functions: `a_mean_sd`, `a_median`,  `a_n_true_and_freq`, `a_count`, `a_q1q3`, `a_iqr`, `a_range`.
* New default p-value method in `s_test_proportion_diff`: Chi-Squared Test with Schouten Correction.
* Add new function `t_contingency` for contingency tables.
* Renamed the class `splitText` to `dynamicSplitText` to resolve the name conflict with the package `ggpubr`.
* Add `rreplace_format` for tabulation post-processing.
* Add new tern function `t_ancova` to create `ANCOVA` tables, as well as corresponding elementary table function `t_el_ancova` and summary function `s_ancova`.

* Added new CI methods (`Agresti-Coull`, `Jeffreys`) for `s_proportion`.
* Added new CI methods `anderson-hauck` and `newcombe` to `s_proportion_diff`.
* Added new p-value methods (Fisher's Exact, Chi-Squared Test with Schouten Correction) for `s_test_proportion_diff`.
* The binary summary table function `t_binary_outcome` takes now lists (instead of character vectors) specified by the helper function `control_binary_comparison` as the arguments `strat_analysis` and `unstrat_analysis`. Odds Ratio estimates and CIs are now removable and included by default, similarly to the other subsections of the arm comparison analyses. Also added argument `rsp_multinomial`.
* Add new table function `t_el_multinomial_proportion`.
* Add new table function `t_abn_shift`.
* Add new `MMRM` analysis function `s_mmrm`, as well as corresponding table functions `t_mmrm_lsmeans`, `t_mmrm_cov`, `t_mmrm_diagnostic`, `t_mmrm_fixed`, and plot functions `g_mmrm_lsmeans`, `g_mmrm_diagnostic`. The results of these match SAS results (up to numeric precision).
* Deprecated old `MMRM` functions `a_mmrm` and `t_mmrm` (they give a deprecation warning but still work) to remove in the next release. The reason is that the results of these functions don't match SAS results.
* Fix bug in `g_km` related to numbers in patients at risk table to correct numbers for integer time-to-event variable inputs.

* Added new tern function `t_events_patyear` to create event table adjusted person-years.
* Added new tern function `t_abnormality` and the elementary table function `t_el_abnormality`.
* Removed `grade_levels` argument from `t_events_term_grade_id` functions. Post-processing by reordering the leaves of the table tree creates a different ordering of rows if required. Creating a helper function will occur at a later time.
* Added `prune_zero_rows` argument to `t_events_per_term_grade_id` and `t_max_grade_per_id` to not show rows of all zeros as they can clutter the visualization in the Shiny app and make it slower.
