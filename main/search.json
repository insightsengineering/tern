First start data preparation steps set analysis dataset. select endpoint analyze PARAMCD define logical variable is_rsp indicates whether patient classified responder . create summary proportion responders treatment group, use estimate_proportion() layout creating function: specify arm table used reference, use argument ref_group split_cols_by(). change reference arm “B: Placebo” arm displayed first column: customize analysis, can use method conf_level arguments modify type confidence interval calculated: next table section needed summarize difference response rates reference arm comparison arm. Use estimate_proportion_diff() layout creating function : final section needed complete table includes statistical test difference response rates. Use test_proportion_diff() layout creating function : customize output, use method argument select Chi-Squared test Schouten correction. Now can put table sections together one layout pipeline.
