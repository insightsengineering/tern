\arguments{
\item{df}{(\code{data.frame})\cr data set containing all analysis variables.}

\item{denom}{(\code{string})\cr choice of denominator for patient proportions. Can be:
\itemize{
\item \code{N_col}: total number of patients in this column across rows
\item \code{n}: number of patients with any occurrences
}}

\item{.N_col}{(\code{integer})\cr column-wise N (column count) for the full column being analyzed that is typically
passed by \code{rtables}.}

\item{.df_row}{(\code{data.frame})\cr data frame across all of the columns for the given row split.}

\item{drop}{(\code{flag})\cr should non appearing occurrence levels be dropped from the resulting table.
Note that in that case the remaining occurrence levels in the table are sorted alphabetically.}

\item{.var}{(\code{string})\cr single variable name that is passed by \code{rtables} when requested
by a statistics function.}

\item{id}{(\code{string})\cr subject variable name.}

\item{lyt}{(\code{layout})\cr input layout where analyses will be added to.}

\item{vars}{(\code{character})\cr variable names for the primary analysis variable to be iterated over.}

\item{var_labels}{(\code{character})\cr character for label.}

\item{show_labels}{(\code{string})\cr label visibility: one of "default", "visible" and "hidden".}

\item{riskdiff}{(\code{flag})\cr whether a risk difference column is present. When set to \code{TRUE}, \code{\link[=add_riskdiff]{add_riskdiff()}} must be
used as \code{split_fun} in the prior column split of the table layout, specifying which columns should be compared.
See \code{\link[=stat_propdiff_ci]{stat_propdiff_ci()}} for details on risk difference calculation.}

\item{nested}{(\code{flag})\cr whether this layout instruction should be applied within the existing layout structure \emph{if
possible} (\code{TRUE}, the default) or as a new top-level element (\code{FALSE}). Ignored if it would nest a split.
underneath analyses, which is not allowed.}

\item{...}{additional arguments for the lower level functions.}

\item{table_names}{(\code{character})\cr this can be customized in case that the same \code{vars} are analyzed multiple times,
to avoid warnings from \code{rtables}.}

\item{.stats}{(\code{character})\cr statistics to select for the table.}

\item{.formats}{(named \code{character} or \code{list})\cr formats for the statistics. See Details in \code{analyze_vars} for more
information on the \code{"auto"} setting.}

\item{.labels}{(named \code{character})\cr labels for the statistics (without indent).}

\item{.indent_mods}{(named \code{integer})\cr indent modifiers for the labels. Defaults to 0, which corresponds to the
unmodified default behavior. Can be negative.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{s_count_occurrences()} returns a list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{count}: list of counts with one element per occurrence.
\item \code{count_fraction}: list of counts and fractions with one element per occurrence.
\item \code{fraction}: list of numerators and denominators with one element per occurrence.
}
}

\itemize{
\item \code{a_count_occurrences()} returns the corresponding list with formatted \code{\link[rtables:CellValue]{rtables::CellValue()}}.
}

\itemize{
\item \code{count_occurrences()} returns a layout object suitable for passing to further layouting functions,
or to \code{\link[rtables:build_table]{rtables::build_table()}}. Adding this function to an \code{rtable} layout will add formatted rows containing
the statistics from \code{s_count_occurrences()} to the table layout.

Functions for analyzing frequencies and fractions of occurrences for patients with occurrence
data. Primary analysis variables are the dictionary terms. All occurrences are counted for total
counts. Multiple occurrences within patient at the lowest term level displayed in the table are
counted only once.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{s_count_occurrences()}: Statistics function which counts number of patients that report an
occurrence.

\item \code{a_count_occurrences()}: Formatted analysis function which is used as \code{afun}
in \code{count_occurrences()}.

\item \code{count_occurrences()}: Layout-creating function which can take statistics function arguments
and additional format arguments. This function is a wrapper for \code{\link[rtables:analyze]{rtables::analyze()}}.

}}
\note{
By default, occurrences which don't appear in a given row split are dropped from the table and
the occurrences in the table are sorted alphabetically per row split. Therefore, the corresponding layout
needs to use \code{split_fun = drop_split_levels} in the \code{split_rows_by} calls. Use \code{drop = FALSE} if you would
like to show all occurrences.
