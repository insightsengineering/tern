\arguments{
\item{df}{(\code{data.frame})\cr data set containing all analysis variables.}

\item{denom}{(\code{string})\cr choice of denominator for patient proportions. Can be:
\itemize{
\item \code{N_col}: total number of patients in this column across rows
\item \code{n}: number of patients with any occurrences
}}

\item{.N_col}{(\code{count})\cr row-wise N (row group count) for the group of observations being analyzed
(i.e. with no column-based subsetting) that is passed by \code{rtables}.}

\item{.df_row}{(\code{data.frame})\cr data frame across all of the columns for the given row split.}

\item{drop}{(\code{flag})\cr should non appearing occurrence levels be dropped from the resulting table.
Note that in that case the remaining occurrence levels in the table are sorted alphabetically.}

\item{.var}{(\code{string})\cr single variable name that is passed by \code{rtables} when requested
by a statistics function.}

\item{id}{(\code{string})\cr subject variable name.}

\item{lyt}{(\code{layout})\cr input layout where analyses will be added to.}

\item{vars}{(\code{character})\cr variable names for the primary analysis variable to be iterated over.}

\item{var_labels}{(\code{character})\cr character for label.}

\item{show_labels}{(\code{string})\cr label visibility: one of "default", "visible" and "hidden".}

\item{...}{additional arguments for the lower level functions.}

\item{table_names}{(\code{character})\cr this can be customized in case that the same \code{vars} are analyzed multiple times,
to avoid warnings from \code{rtables}.}

\item{.stats}{(\code{character})\cr statistics to select for the table.}

\item{.formats}{(named \code{character} or \code{list})\cr formats for the statistics.}

\item{.labels}{(named \code{character})\cr labels for the statistics (without indent).}

\item{.indent_mods}{(named \code{integer})\cr indent modifiers for the labels.}
}

\item{count_fraction}{list of counts and fractions with one element per occurrence.}
\item{fraction}{list of numerators and denominators with one element per occurrence.}

\details{
Functions for analyzing frequencies and fractions of occurrences for patients with occurrence
data. Primary analysis variables are the dictionary terms. All occurrences are counted for total
counts. Multiple occurrences within patient at the lowest term level displayed in the table are
counted only once. Note that by default occurrences which don't appear in a given row split
are dropped from the table and the occurrences in the table are sorted alphabetically per row split.
Therefore the corresponding layout needs to use \code{split_fun = drop_split_levels} in the \code{split_rows_by}
calls. Use \code{drop = FALSE} if you would like to show all occurrences.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{s_count_occurrences()}: Statistics function which counts number of patients that report an
occurrence.

\item \code{a_count_occurrences()}: Formatted Analysis function which can be further customized by calling
\code{\link[rtables:make_afun]{rtables::make_afun()}} on it. It is used as \code{afun} in \code{\link[rtables:analyze]{rtables::analyze()}}.

\item \code{count_occurrences()}: Analyze Function that counts occurrences as part of \code{rtables} layouts.
