every tested level in comparison to the reference level.
}
\details{
Let's \code{ARM} being a factor with level A, B, C; let's be B the reference level,
a model calling the formula including \code{pairwise(ARM)} will result in two models:
\itemize{
\item A model including only levels A and B, and effect of A estimated in reference to B.
\item A model including only levels C and B, the effect of C estimated in reference to B.
