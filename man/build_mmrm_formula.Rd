\usage{
build_mmrm_formula(
  vars,
  cor_struct = c("unstructured", "random-quadratic", "random-slope",
    "compound-symmetry")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vars}{(named \code{list} of \code{string} or \code{character})\cr specifying the variables in the MMRM.
The following elements need to be included as character vectors and match corresponding columns
in \code{data}:
\describe{
\item{response}{the response variable}
\item{covariates}{the additional covariate terms (might also include interactions)}
\item{id}{the subject ID variable}
\item{arm}{the treatment group variable (factor)}
\item{visit}{the visit variable (factor)}
}
Note that the main effects and interaction of \code{arm} and \code{visit} are by default included in the model.}

\item{cor_struct}{a string specifying the correlation structure, defaults to
\code{"unstructured"}. See the details.}
}
\value{
the complete MMRM formula to use with \code{\link[lme4:lmer]{lme4::lmer()}}.
}

Helper function to build the MMRM formula.
